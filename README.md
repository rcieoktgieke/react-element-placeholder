# react-element-placeholder

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A React component to display a placeholder until an asynchronously-loaded element is ready to display.

The `react-element-placeholder` package is broken into several components generally composed together to form a useful placeholder. These individual components may also be used independently.
1. `LoadableImage` wraps an `img` element and calls back when the file has been loaded
1. `Placeholder` renders a arbitrary placeholder element until its child reports being loaded
1. `ScaledComponent` determines the correct scaling to fit an element of known size within given dimensions, while maintaining its aspect ratio
1. `SizeMeasure` dynamically determines the dimensions of its parent element
